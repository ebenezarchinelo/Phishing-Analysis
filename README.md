# Phishing Email Analysis Report

## Introduction <a id="introduction"></a>
This project involved a detailed analysis of a suspicious email claiming to originate from Binance with the subject "Binance cybersecurity". It states that the recipient‚Äôs email was found in a database of leaked personal data from crypto projects.  The Cybersecurity Department detected over 120 leaks involving the recipient‚Äôs data. A checkbox option prompts the user to "Get Compensated in Bitcoin." As a SOC analyst, I investigated the email's legitimacy using tools like MXToolbox, VirusTotal, and AbuseIPDB. This report documents my methodology, findings, and recommendations showcasing email analysis as one of my SOC skills.

## Objective <a id="objective"></a> 
The goal of the analysis was to determine the emails's authenticity by analyzing its headers, IP origins, authentication status, and content. I examined email headers, authentication protocols, and senders details, discovering multible indicators of spoofing.

## Methodology <a id="methodology"></a> 
I conducted a structured analysis of the email in these steps: 
1. Initial triage: quickly assesed and determined the potential impact of this email.
2. Content Examination: analyzed the email content for language, formatting, suspicious elements like reply-to address, undue sense of urgency and other social engineering red flags.
3.  Header Analysis: Extracted and examined email headers to investiage mail transfer agent, trace the message‚Äôs path and identify discrepancies. 
4.  sender analysis (IP and Domain Analysis): I used MXToolbox and AbuseIPDB to verify the originating IP and sender domain. carried out email authentication checks by evaluating SPF, DKIM, and DMARC results to assess sender authenticity.
5. Timestamp Verification: Analyzed hop timestamps for anomalies indicating manipulation.

## Tools Used <a id="tools used"></a>
1. Sublime Text for initial email header analysis.
2. MXToolbox: For analyzing headers and email‚Äôs server.
3. VirusTotal: To check the domain () Ip address() reputation.
4. AbuseIPDB: To geolocate and assess the originating IP (89.144.44.41).
5. Manual Header Parsing: To extract authentication results and sender details.

## Key Findings <a id="key findings"></a>

### 1. Headers
Subject:Binance Cybersecurity

From:info@libreriacies.es (Non Binace affliated)

Return-Path:info@libreriacies.es (Non Binace affliated)

Sender IP:217[.]18[.]161[.]43

Resolve Host:Trevenque Sistemas De Informacion S.l. (Non Binace affliated)

Message-ID:	<C2C067AE.1670873@libreriacies.es>

### 2. Suspicious Email Routing Path
#### Email Routing Analysis
| Hop | Source | Destination | Status | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------------|--------|-------|
| 1 | `smtp.gmail.com`<br>`43.230.161.16` | `serlogal.arnoia.com` | ‚ùå Blacklisted | **Spoofed Gmail IP** - Not a valid Google server |
| 2 | `serlogal.arnoia.com`<br>`217.18.161.43` | `BN8NAM12FT011.mail.protection.outlook.com` | ‚úÖ Clean | 6s delay - Suspicious relay before Microsoft |
| 3 | `BN8NAM12FT011...`<br>`2603:10b6:408:106:cafe::a0` | `BN9PR03CA0616.outlook.office365.com` | ‚úÖ Clean | Normal Microsoft internal transfer |
| 4 | `BN9PR03CA0616...`<br>`2603:10b6:408:106::21` | `PH0PR19MB5396.namprd19.prod.outlook.com` | ‚úÖ Clean | Standard Microsoft routing |
| 5 | `PH0PR19MB5396...`<br>`::1` | `MN0PR19MB6312.namprd19.prod.outlook.com` | ‚ùå Blacklisted | **HTTPS anomaly** - Loopback IP abuse |

### Key Indicators
- üö© **Hop 1**: Spoofed Gmail IP (blacklisted)
- üö© **Hop 2**: Unverified relay server (`arnoia.com`)
- üö© **Hop 5**: Blacklisted destination with HTTPS protocol

### Conclusion
High-confidence phishing attempt with:
- Forged headers
- Suspicious routing path
- Multiple blacklisted nodes	

### 3. Authentication Failures

### üìß Email Authentication Results

| Check         | Result               | Status Icon | Implications                              |
|--------------|----------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **SPF**      | `pass` (217.18.161.43) | ‚úÖ          | Sender IP authorized by domain            |
| **DKIM**     | `none` (not signed)  | ‚ùå          | No content integrity protection           |
| **DMARC**    | `bestguesspass`      | ‚ö†Ô∏è          | No enforced policy (domain vulnerable)    |
| **Composite**| `pass` (Reason 109)  | ‚úÖ          | Microsoft heuristic approval              |

üîç **Legend**:
- ‚úÖ = Pass
- ‚ùå = Fail/Missing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è = Partial/Best-Guess

### 4. Suspicious email content
1. The use of Fear and Urgency in Email content
Subject: ‚ÄúBinance Cybersecurity‚Äù
Finding: The subject creates a sense of fear and urgency, a strategy to prompt users to click malicious links in the email.
2. The promise of compensation in Bitcoin to bypass critical thinking..
3. Wrong Binance logo.
4. Non-professional content formatting.
5. Generic Greeting.

### 5. Malicious Link

Conclusion
This phishing email analysis project demonstrated my ability to detect and analyze spoofed emails using industry-standard tools and methodologies. By identifying critical indicators‚Äîsuspicious IP origins, authentication failures, mismatched domains, and tracking pixels, I confirmed the email as a phishing attempt. The findings underscore the importance of robust email authentication and proactive security measures. This project enhances my portfolio as a SOC analyst, showcasing my expertise in threat detection, log analysis, and DFIR. I welcome feedback or contributions to improve this analysis, and I‚Äôm eager to apply these skills in SOC or incident response roles.
